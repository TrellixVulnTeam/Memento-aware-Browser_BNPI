<!-- A SeekBar track is composed of up to three components:

1) A line for showing playback progress (android:id/progress).
2) A line for showing buffering progress (android:id/secondaryProgress).
3) A background element (@android:id/background), which frames the playback and buffering lines,
   thereby indicating how much remains of playback and/or buffering.

The buffering progress line (item 2 above) is omitted here, because it is not needed due to the fact
that the videos are all readily available on disk and don't need to be downloaded. -->
